## Change Log

### 1.5.0

==== BREAKING CHANGE ====

- The queue is now runned outside of the Magento default cron system. To run the jobs you will need to run
  the `algolia_queue_runner` indexer via the following command `php -f shell/indexer.php --reindex algolia_queue_runner`
  You can add it to your crontab just add this line:
  `*/5 * * * * php -f /absolute/path/to/magento/shell/indexer.php -- -reindex algolia_queue_runner`
  
- As this is a major update you will loose your settings and will need to reconfigure the extension
