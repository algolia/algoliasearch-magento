You can also use '*' to retrieve all\n*   values when an attributesToRetrieve setting is specified for your index.\n* - attributesToHighlight: a string that contains the list of attributes you\n*   want to highlight according to the query.\n*   Attributes are separated by a comma. You can also use an array (for example [\"name\",\"address\"]).\n*   If an attribute has no match for the query, the raw value is returned.\n*   By default all indexed text attributes are highlighted.\n*   You can use `*` if you want to highlight all textual attributes.\n*   Numerical attributes are not highlighted.\n*   A matchLevel is returned for each highlighted attribute and can contain:\n*      - full: if all the query terms were found in the attribute,\n*      - partial: if only some of the query terms were found,\n*      - none: if none of the query terms were found.\n* - attributesToSnippet: a string that contains the list of attributes to snippet alongside\n* the number of words to return (syntax is `attributeName:nbWords`).\n*    Attributes are separated by a comma (Example: attributesToSnippet=name:10,content:10).\n*    You can also use an array (Example: attributesToSnippet: ['name:10','content:10']).\n*    By default no snippet is computed.\n* - minWordSizefor1Typo: the minimum number of characters in a query word to accept one typo in this word.\n* Defaults to 3.\n* - minWordSizefor2Typos: the minimum number of characters in a query word\n* to accept two typos in this word. Defaults to 7.\n* - getRankingInfo: if set to 1, the result hits will contain ranking\n* information in _rankingInfo attribute.\n* - aroundLatLng: search for entries around a given\n* latitude/longitude (specified as two floats separated by a comma).\n*   For example aroundLatLng=47.316669,5.016670).\n*   You can specify the maximum distance in meters with the aroundRadius parameter (in meters)\n*   and the precision for ranking with aroundPrecision\n*   (for example if you set aroundPrecision=100, two objects that are distant of\n*   less than 100m will be considered as identical for \"geo\" ranking parameter).\n*   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n*   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n* - insideBoundingBox: search entries inside a given area defined by the two extreme points\n* of a rectangle (defined by 4 floats: p1Lat,p1Lng,p2Lat,p2Lng).\n*   For example insideBoundingBox=47.3165,4.9665,47.3424,5.0201).\n*   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n*   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n* - numericFilters: a string that contains the list of numeric filters you want to\n* apply separated by a comma.\n*   The syntax of one filter is `attributeName` followed by `operand` followed by `value`.\n*   Supported operands are `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>` and `>=`.\n*   You can have multiple conditions on one attribute like for example numericFilters=price>100,price<1000.\n*   You can also use an array (for example numericFilters: [\"price>100\",\"price<1000\"]).\n* - tagFilters: filter the query by a set of tags. You can AND tags by separating them by commas.\n*   To OR tags, you must add parentheses. For example, tags=tag1,(tag2,tag3) means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n*   You can also use an array, for example tagFilters: [\"tag1\",[\"tag2\",\"tag3\"]]\n*   means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n*   At indexing, tags should be added in the _tags** attribute\n*   of objects (for example {\"_tags\":[\"tag1\",\"tag2\"]}).\n* - facetFilters: filter the query by a list of facets.\n*   Facets are separated by commas and each facet is encoded as `attributeName:value`.\n*   For example: `facetFilters=category:Book,author:John%20Doe`.\n*   You can also use an array (for example `[\"category:Book\",\"author:John%20Doe\"]`).\n* - facets: List of object attributes that you want to use for faceting.\n*   Comma separated list: `\"category,author\"` or array `['category','author']`\n*   Only attributes that have been added in **attributesForFaceting** index setting\n*   can be used in this parameter.\n*   You can also use `*` to perform faceting on all attributes specified in **attributesForFaceting**.\n* - queryType: select how the query words are interpreted, it can be one of the following value:\n*    - prefixAll: all query words are interpreted as prefixes,\n*    - prefixLast: only the last word is interpreted as a prefix (default behavior),\n*    - prefixNone: no query word is interpreted as a prefix. This option is not recommended.\n* - optionalWords: a string that contains the list of words that should\n* be considered as optional when found in the query.\n*   Comma separated and array are accepted.\n* - distinct: If set to 1, enable the distinct feature (disabled by default)\n* if the attributeForDistinct index setting is set.\n*   This feature is similar to the SQL \"distinct\" keyword: when enabled\n*   in a query with the distinct=1 parameter,\n*   all hits containing a duplicate value for the attributeForDistinct attribute are removed from results.\n*   For example, if the chosen attribute is show_name and several hits have\n*   the same value for show_name, then only the best\n*   one is kept and others are removed.\n* - restrictSearchableAttributes: List of attributes you want to use for\n* textual search (must be a subset of the attributesToIndex index setting)\n* either comma separated or as an array\n* @param callback the result callback called with two arguments:\n*  error: null or Error('message').

For example, even if other promises given to the\n  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\n  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\n  promise will become rejected:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve('promise 1');\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\n    }, 100);\n  });\n\n  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n    // Code here never runs\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\n    // promise 1 became fulfilled\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\n  ```\n\n  @method race\n  @static\n  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\n  promise to settle.\n*/\nfunction race(entries) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n\n  if (!isArray(entries)) {\n    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\n      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\n    });\n  } else {\n    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\n      var length = entries.length;\n      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\n  It is shorthand for the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method reject\n  @static\n  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n*/\nfunction reject(reason) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\n  _reject(promise, reason);\n  return promise;\n}\n\nfunction needsResolver() {\n  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n}\n\nfunction needsNew() {\n  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n}\n\n/**\n  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\nfunction Promise(resolver) {\n  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n  this._subscribers = [];\n\n  if (noop !== resolver) {\n    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n  }\n}\n\nPromise.all = all;\nPromise.race = race;\nPromise.resolve = resolve;\nPromise.reject = reject;\nPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\nPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\nPromise._asap = asap;\n\nPromise.prototype = {\n  constructor: Promise,\n\n  /**\n    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function(user){\n      // user is available\n    }, function(reason){\n      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Chaining\n    --------\n  \n    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return user.name;\n    }, function (reason) {\n      return 'default name';\n    }).then(function (userName) {\n      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n      // will be `'default name'`\n    });\n  \n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n    }, function (reason) {\n      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n    });\n    ```\n    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Assimilation\n    ------------\n  \n    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // The user's comments are now available\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Simple Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let result;\n  \n    try {\n      result = findResult();\n      // success\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // failure\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Errback Example\n  \n    ```js\n    findResult(function(result, err){\n      if (err) {\n        // failure\n      } else {\n        // success\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Promise Example;\n  \n    ```javascript\n    findResult().then(function(result){\n      // success\n    },
